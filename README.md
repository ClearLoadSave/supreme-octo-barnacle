# supreme-octo-barnacle
2D game made with pure Java

Used the name because it was recommended by GitHub

Why, you got a problem with that?

*Game Details

Old Pokemon style game
Shitty graphics
Half of the crap I coded doesn't even work properly
Player movement is sticky as hell
Very bad spritesheet importing system
Did not convert into a .jar file so you need to compile it yourself

Work In Progress
